Barrel Distortion correction Algorithm:

This MatLab algorithm for barrel distortion correction can correct an image with a known barrel distortion cofficient K\_1. The algorithm first distorts an image with a known vaue of K\_1 to then it corrects the distorted image. 

This is the initial stage of the algorithm. Further improvement is to be made.
